# Overview <a name="overview"></a>

[EXAMPLE_EVALUATE_COVARIANCE.ipynb](../EXAMPLE_EVALUATE_COVARIANCE.ipynb)
computes real-space and Fourier-space galaxy/shear covariances with
separate Gaussian (G), super-sample (SSC), connected non-Gaussian (cNG)
and total matrices. The real-space vector contains cosmic shear,
galaxy–galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering, using five lens and five
source bins. The Fourier example contains E-mode shear, galaxy–shear
and galaxy-density bandpowers.

The notebook runs CAMB once, computes both spaces at several accuracy
boosts, reports positivity and refinement diagnostics, plots the physical
components, and saves NumPy archives. It does not load the likelihood's
supplied covariance.

> [!NOTE]
> The forecast uses massless neutrinos, linear galaxy bias, zero IA,
> magnification and RSD, Limber spectra and a spherical-cap footprint.
> It includes isotropic halo SSC and five halo cNG terms. These choices
> need numerical and physical validation for the intended inference.

# Running the covariance notebook <a name="running"></a>

We assume Cocoa and the LSST Y1 project are installed, users have run
`conda activate cocoa`, the shell is Bash, and the current folder is
`cocoa/Cocoa`. The notebook uses the Python environment activated by Cocoa.

**Step :one:**: activate Cocoa's private Python environment.

    source start_cocoa.sh

**Step :two:**: compile the LSST Y1 interface, including the covariance components.

    unset IGNORE_COSMOLIKE_LSST_Y1_CODE
    source ./projects/lsst_y1/scripts/compile_lsst_y1.sh

**Step :three:**: start Jupyter.

    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888

**Step :four:**: open the URL printed by Jupyter and select
`projects/lsst_y1/EXAMPLE_EVALUATE_COVARIANCE.ipynb`.

**Step :five:**: select **Kernel → Restart Kernel and Run All Cells**.

The notebook computes the real-space and Fourier matrices for accuracy
boosts 1 and 2. It prints matrix dimensions, positivity diagnostics and
changes relative to the highest tested boost, then displays the figures.
The final cell saves these files in `projects/lsst_y1/covariance/`:

| Output | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `forecast_real.npz` | Angular G, SSC, cNG, total, row map, means and resolved settings. |
| `forecast_fourier.npz` | Fourier G, SSC, cNG, total, row map, means and resolved settings. |
| `forecast_camb.npz` | CAMB tables used for the calculation. |

Rerunning the final cell replaces these computed output files.

> [!NOTE]
> The notebook assigns eight threads to CosmoLike's OpenMP loops and
> one thread to BLAS. Change `ci.set_omp_threads(n=8)` in the notebook
> if fewer cores are available. Run one calculation at a time when
> measuring execution time.

> [!TIP]
> To inspect the forecast inputs before running CAMB, see
> [which survey the example uses](#survey).

# Changing the covariance accuracy <a name="accuracy"></a>

We assume users have run `conda activate cocoa`, use Bash, and are in
`cocoa/Cocoa`. The interface must already be compiled.

**Step :one:**: activate Cocoa's private Python environment.

    source start_cocoa.sh

**Step :two:**: start Jupyter and open
`projects/lsst_y1/EXAMPLE_EVALUATE_COVARIANCE.ipynb`.

    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888

**Step :three:**: set the first calculation's accuracy in its configuration cell.

```python
boosts = [1, 2]
settings = survey.configuration(accuracy_boost=boosts[0])
```

`accuracy_boost` is the single user control. Supported values are
1, 2, 4 and 8. It raises the covariance's multipole cutoffs and radial,
angular, halo and lensing-window integration resolution together. It also
refines the non-Gaussian multipole table. It leaves
CAMB and data-vector accuracy settings unchanged.

**Step :four:**: choose which values to compare in the refinement cell.

```python
boosts = [1, 2, 4]
```

For the more expensive comparison, include boost 8:

```python
boosts = [1, 2, 4, 8]
```

**Step :five:**: restart the kernel and run all cells.

The calculation keeps the cosmology, galaxy distributions, noise, angular
bins and Fourier-band endpoints fixed. Only the covariance accuracy changes. The highest
boost in the comparison supplies the reference matrix for the difference
plots and variance-ratio table.

> [!NOTE]
> A larger boost is a numerical resolution, not a guaranteed survey
> accuracy. Boost 1 is a teaching example. Boost 8 uses more modes and
> quadrature nodes and can require substantially more memory and time.
> See [how to check convergence](#convergence).

# Reading the figures <a name="figures"></a>

| Figure | What it teaches |
| --- | --- |
| Split-triangle correlation matrix | Compare the initial calculation in the lower triangle with the highest tested boost in the upper triangle. Each matrix is normalized by its own diagonal. |
| G, SSC and cNG maps and histograms | Compare each component after normalization by the total diagonal variances. |
| Error changes | Compare first-source-bin standard deviations with the reference, in percent, for angles and Fourier bands. |
| Generalized-mode report | Bound variance changes over every linear combination of measurements. |

The correlation comparison follows the layout of
[Friedrich et al. (2021), Fig. 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08568).
The component maps and histogram adapt
[Barreira, Krause & Schmidt (2018), Fig. 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04266).
These figures display the notebook's calculation, not data from the papers.

Negative correlations remain visible. A grey cell in an element-ratio
map means its denominator is zero or too small for the selected cutoff.
No plot clips eigenvalues or adjusts the covariance.

# Running the tests <a name="tests"></a>

We assume users have run `conda activate cocoa`, use Bash, and are in
`cocoa/Cocoa`, with the LSST Y1 interface compiled.

**Step :one:**: activate Cocoa's private Python environment.

    source start_cocoa.sh

**Step :two:**: run the covariance tests.

    python -m pytest projects/lsst_y1/tests/covariance

The tests check covariance algebra, quadrature, thread repeatability and
the notebook helpers. The [covariance test guide](../tests/covariance/README.md)
describes each check.

For the ordinary data-vector tests, we again assume the activated Conda
Cocoa environment, Bash, and the current folder `cocoa/Cocoa`.

**Step :one:**: activate Cocoa's private Python environment.

    source start_cocoa.sh

**Step :two:**: run only the data-vector tests.

    python -m pytest projects/lsst_y1/tests/data_vector

These tests compare likelihood predictions with the stored references.
The [data-vector test guide](../tests/data_vector/README.md) explains them.

## FAQ: Which survey does the example use? <a name="survey"></a>

The redshift files are `data/lsst_y1_lens.nz` and
`data/lsst_y1_source.nz`, relative to the project. Each has five
individually normalized bin distributions. Normalization describes the
redshift shape, not the number of galaxies in that bin.

The [LSST DESC Science Requirements Document](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01669)
guides the example's total densities, area and per-component shape
dispersion. The equal allocation among five bins is an explicit forecast
assumption; it is not inferred from the normalized redshift columns.

| Survey input | Example choice |
| --- | --- |
| Survey area | 12,300 square degrees |
| Total lens density | 18 galaxies per square arcminute |
| Lens density per bin | 3.6 galaxies per square arcminute |
| Total source density | 10 galaxies per square arcminute |
| Source density per bin | 2 galaxies per square arcminute |
| Ellipticity dispersion per component | 0.26 |
| Full real-space vector | 1,560 entries: 60 observable rows, each with 26 angles |
| Fourier vector | 675 entries: 45 observable rows, each with 15 bands |
| Fourier bands | Integer multipoles 30 through 4,000, with mode-count weights |
| Angular bins | 26 logarithmic bins from 2.5 to 900 arcminutes |
| Neutrino mass | Zero |
| Intrinsic alignment | Zero |
| Photo-z shifts | Zero |
| Magnification | Zero |

The cosmology and remaining choices are written explicitly in
`lsst_y1_covariance.py`. They define a forecast; they are not the
parameters of the project's stored likelihood reference.

## FAQ: What does the calculation include? <a name="gaussian"></a>

For Gaussian fields, a four-point expectation separates into products
of two-point expectations. A covariance between measured spectra AB and
CD therefore needs AC, BD, AD and BC spectra, even if those crossed pairs
are excluded from the measured data vector. The example retains the
complete field matrix before assembling the measured rows.

The signal uses nonlinear matter power and Limber projection. Spherical
spin operators average the resulting angular spectra over each angular
bin. The signal covariance uses the $`f_{\rm sky}`$ approximation.

Pure white noise extends to arbitrarily high multipoles. The calculation
replaces that infinite sum with the analytic pair-noise expression using
a spherical-cap footprint. Signal and mixed signal-noise terms retain
the finite multipole sum. A cap correction to noise pair counts does not
make the signal covariance an exact treatment of an irregular footprint.

Fourier bandpowers include pure noise inside the finite band sum. They
average the core spectra directly. Real-space means retain Cocoa's
extra source-leg factor for matching its angular-transform convention.
Each convention is applied consistently to G, SSC and cNG signal terms;
white noise receives neither source conversion.

SSC describes correlations induced by modes larger than the survey;
cNG describes the connected four-point contribution inside it.
The notebook computes both terms for every measured cross block. SSC
uses common shell responses before their weighted outer products; cNG
uses the 1-halo, 2-halo (1+3), 2-halo (2+2), 3-halo and 4-halo terms.
These are approximations, not a simulation calibration. See
[Krause & Eifler](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05779) and
[Takada & Hu](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6994) for the physical decomposition.

## FAQ: How can users check convergence? <a name="convergence"></a>

Compare successive boosts with the same physical inputs. The notebook
prints the largest departure of the generalized covariance eigenvalues
from one. They solve

```math
C_b v = \lambda C_{\rm ref} v.
```

The smallest and largest eigenvalues bound the variance ratio for any
linear combination of measurements. This checks coupled directions that
a diagonal comparison alone can miss. Raw largest covariance eigenvalues
do not identify the most informative cosmological modes.

Every total matrix must have nonnegative variance in every direction;
an invertible total must be positive definite. A positive diagonal alone
is insufficient. The notebook reports eigenvalues without repairing them.

The reference boost is only the highest resolution tested. Establish its
stability with further refinement, then assess marginalized parameter
errors and the Fisher Figure of Merit for the intended survey. The
likelihood's data-vector $`\lvert\Delta\chi^2\rvert<0.2`$ rule is not a
covariance convergence requirement.

## FAQ: How can users reuse the calculation? <a name="reuse"></a>

A project supplies its own initialized interface, redshift files, survey
numbers and physical choices. The shared Python package prepares arrays
and asks the covariance C components to perform the integration and
projection. Copy the small survey adapter, not those algorithms.

Other project interfaces must link the same covariance sources before
running these examples. Cluster observables need their own physical
model; changing the number of galaxy bins does not create a cluster
covariance.

Rectangular projection inputs allow Python to request matrix subblocks.
The C routines use OpenMP inside one process and never start MPI work.
A future Python dispatcher can distribute those subblocks while keeping
all cross correlations in the assembled matrix.
